Gut microbiota can interact with the central nervous system (CNS) through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The interaction is mediated by microbial secretions, metabolic interventions, and neural stimulation. Here, we review and summarize the regulatory pathways (immune, neural, neuroendocrine, or metabolic systems) in the microbiota-gut-brain axis in AD pathogenesis. Besides, we highlight the significant roles of the intestinal epithelial barrier and blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the microbiota-gut-brain axis. During the progression of AD, there is a gradual shift in the gut microbiota and host co-metabolic relationship, leading to gut dysbiosis, and the imbalance of microbial secretions and metabolites, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These products may affect the CNS metabolic state and immune balance through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Further, we summarize the potential microbiota-gut-brain axis-targeted therapy including carbohydrates, probiotics, dietary measures, and propose new strategies toward the development of anti-AD drugs. Taken together, the data in this review suggest that remodeling the gut microbiota may present a tractable strategy in the management and development of new therapeutics against AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.\nKeywords: AlzheimerÔøΩÔøΩs disease; Bacteroides; bloodÔøΩCbrain barrier; enteric nervous system; gut microbiota; lipopolysaccharides; microbial amyloid; microbiota-gut-brain axis; oligosaccharides; short-chain fatty acids.\n? 2021 Si-Ran Zhong et al., published by De Gruyter.\n","permalink":"https://fanzhang9.github.io/cn/functional-roles-of-the-microbiota-gut-brain-axis-in-alzheimers-disease-implications-of-gut-microbiota-targeted-therapy/","summary":"Functional roles of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease: Implications of gut microbiota-targeted therapy Transl Neurosci. 2021 Dec 28;12(1):581-600. doi: 10.1515/tnsci-2020-0206. eCollection 2021 Jan 1.\nAuthors Affiliations 1 School of Health Medicine, Guangzhou Huashang College, Guangzhou, 511300, People\u0026rsquo;s Republic of China.\n2 International Institute for Translational Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, 510006, People\u0026rsquo;s Republic of China.\n3 Scientific Research Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanning City, 530200, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, People\u0026rsquo;s Republic of China.","title":"Functional roles of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in Alzheimers disease: Implications of gut microbiota-targeted therapy"},{"content":"MeCP2 prevents age-associated cognitive decline via restoring synaptic plasticity in a senescence-accelerated mouse model Aging Cell. 2021 Sep;20(9):e13451. doi: 10.1111/acel.13451.

Therefore, exploring promising targets to enhance synaptic plasticity in neurodegenerative disorders is crucial. It has been demonstrated that methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) plays a vital role in neuronal development and MeCP2 malfunction causes various neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the role of MeCP2 in neurodegenerative diseases has been less reported. In the study, we found that MeCP2 expression in the hippocampus was reduced in the hippocampus of senescence-accelerated mice P8 (SAMP8) mice. Overexpression of hippocampal MeCP2 could elevate synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in SAMP8 mice, while knockdown of MeCP2 impaired synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in senescence accelerated-resistant 1 (SAMR1) mice. MeCP2-mediated regulation of synaptic plasticity may be associated with CREB1 pathway. These results suggest that MeCP2 plays a vital role in age-related cognitive decline by regulating synaptic plasticity and indicate that MeCP2 may be promising targets for the treatment of age-related cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases.\nKeywords: MeCP2; neurodegenerative disease; synaptic plasticity.\n? 2021 The Authors.
