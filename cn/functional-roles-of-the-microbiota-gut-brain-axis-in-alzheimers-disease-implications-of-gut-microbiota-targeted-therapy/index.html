  "articleBody": "Abstract Increasing scientific evidence demonstrates that the gut microbiota influences normal physiological homeostasis and contributes to pathogenesis, ranging from obesity to neurodegenerative diseases, such as AlzheimerÔøΩÔøΩs disease (AD). Gut microbiota can interact with the central nervous system (CNS) through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The interaction is mediated by microbial secretions, metabolic interventions, and neural stimulation. Here, we review and summarize the regulatory pathways (immune, neural, neuroendocrine, or metabolic systems) in the microbiota-gut-brain axis in AD pathogenesis. Besides, we highlight the significant roles of the intestinal epithelial barrier and bloodÔøΩCbrain barrier (BBB) in the microbiota-gut-brain axis. During the progression of AD, there is a gradual shift in the gut microbiota and host co-metabolic relationship, leading to gut dysbiosis, and the imbalance of microbial secretions and metabolites, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These products may affect the CNS metabolic state and immune balance through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Further, we summarize the potential microbiota-gut-brain axis-targeted therapy including carbohydrates, probiotics, dietary measures, and propose new strategies toward the development of anti-AD drugs. Taken together, the data in this review suggest that remodeling the gut microbiota may present a tractable strategy in the management and development of new therapeutics against AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.\nKeywords Alzheimers disease, microbiota-gut-brain axis, gut microbiota, bloodÔøΩCbrain barrier, lipopolysaccharides, short-chain fatty acids, oligosaccharides, microbial amyloid, enteric nervous system, Bacteroides\n1 Introduction AlzheimerÔøΩÔøΩs disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, affecting 50 million people across the world. Between 2000 and 2013, deaths as a result of cerebrovascular disease decreased by 20%, whereas AD mortality increased by 71% [1].\nThe most prevalent clinical manifestation of AD is progressive memory deficit with multiple cognitive impairments. Based on the ÔøΩÔøΩamyloid cascadeÔøΩÔøΩ hypothesis, AD results from amyloid-ÔøΩÔøΩ (AÔøΩÔøΩ) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles. They are characterized by hyperphosphorylated tau protein and neuronal loss in multiple brain sections including the hippocampus, neocortex, amygdala, and the nucleus basalis of Meynert [2,3]. However, the exact cause of AD remains elusive. Despite the fact that many patients with mild cognitive impairment show no AÔøΩÔøΩ deposits in the brain, some nondemented elderly people have AÔøΩÔøΩ deposits or senile plaques [4]. In recent years, more than 20 anti-AD compounds that target AÔøΩÔøΩ or tau aggregation have shown no efficacy in slowing cognitive deficit [5], raising a great challenge to the ÔøΩÔøΩamyloid cascadeÔøΩÔøΩ hypothesis.\nOn the other hand, neuroinflammation theory suggests that chronic inflammation characterized by microglia activation and innate immune response both in the brain and in the periphery mediates AD progression [6].\nMicroglia is the key player in this process. It is involved in AD pathogenesis by releasing inflammatory mediators, manifested as a major regulator of inflammation, NF-ÔøΩÔøΩB dysregulation, resulting in AÔøΩÔøΩ accumulation and oxidative stress.\nMore importantly, AÔøΩÔøΩ itself is a microglia activator. This cycle has been considered as an underlying factor in AD pathogenesis [7,8]. Persistent neuroinflammatory and astrocytes activation contributes to the bloodÔøΩCbrain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, and thus, to neuronal death and cognitive impairment. Whereas huge efforts have been made towards the development of new drugs targeting inflammation and immune regulation [9,10,11], the options for clinical treatment remain limited [12]. Nevertheless, this reasoning led to the development of the amyloid hypothesis and subsequent pharmacology development, which also faced tremendous challenges. Therefore, the need for the development of new therapeutics against AD remains alive.\nIn the last decade, the human microbiome project has expanded our understanding of the human microbiome and disease development [13,14,15,16,17]. The intestinal microorganisms encode 4 ÔøΩÔøΩ 106 genes, which is about 150ÔøΩÔøΩ higher than humans [13,15], which ultimately contributes to the sophisticated microbial diversity. A plethora of evidence has suggested that dysbiosis of gut microbiota in human beings is closely associated with many illnesses, especially metabolic-related diseases [18,19,20] (insulin resistance Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and liver diseases), cardiovascular diseases [21], or malnutrition [22].\nA growing number of studies have demonstrated variations in the composition of gut microbiota, which contribute to the alteration in brain function and behavior, a phenomenon referred to as the microbiota-gut-brain axis [23,24,25].\nStudies based on germ-free (GF) animals [26], antibiotics [27], probiotics [28], or fecal microbiota transplantation [29] support the pivotal role of gut microbiota in modulating cognition, behavior, and central nervous system (CNS) physiology. Whereas there is evidence that gut microbiota affects brain physiology and AÔøΩÔøΩ accumulation and even AD, its regulatory role in AD still remains elusive. A newly developed drug, GV-971, has been shown to work by regulating gut microbiota dysbiosis, which elucidated a novel way in the development of new anti-AD drugs [30].\nIn this review, we summarize the gut microbiota alteration in crosstalk between the gut and the brain, mediated by the microbiota-gut-brain axis in AD pathogenesis. We highlight the significance of gut microbiota in maintaining host metabolic and immune homeostasis, as well as a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases and AD. Furthermore, we discuss recent research on AD therapy advances, especially in remodeling the gut microbiota. We highlight the potential drug candidate targeting the microbiota-gut-brain axis that may define the discovery of novel therapeutic agents.\n2.?Gut ecosystem and dysbiosis in AD Gut microbiota is a symbiotic system having bacteria, viruses, and fungi in the human gut, which affect human digestion, intestinal biosynthesis, metabolism, and inflammation [31,32]. There are up to 1,000 microbial species that are composed of 90% Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and 10% Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. Like in the legume-rhizobia symbiotic relationship, gut microbiota and the human body is unique ecosystem and is an outcome of biological evolution. Recently, a cohort study of around 2,100 gut microbiota metagenomes uncovered over 22.3 million nonredundant prokaryotic genes, with half of the genes being unique in a single person [33]. Collectively, the gut microbiota is a highly active, extremely dynamic, and vast heterogenetic ecosystem, which is defined by the hostÔøΩÔøΩs age, disease status, diet, environment, and ethnicity [34].\nThe gut microbiota ecosystem is beneficial to human health in several ways:\n(1) Biosynthesis of metabolic co-factors, polysaccharides, and fatty acids to supplement host nutrition [35,36]; (2) Metabolism of products such as cleavage of dietary fiber into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which can modulate intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) permeability, maintain homeostasis of the host immune system and glucose homeostasis [37,38]; On the other hand, microbiota and its metabolism can drive immune functions, which is characterized by cytokine signal release, and consequently, alter the activation status and physiology of neurons and glial cells [39]. (3) Provision of protection against pathogens, as well as maintenance of the homeostasis of the microbiota composition [40,41]. On the contrary, when the IEB is dysfunctional, the secretory neurotoxins or metabolites of enterotoxigenic strains can leak through the barrier causing substantial inflammatory pathology or metabolic diseases. (4) The neuroendocrine system regulated by microbiota can modulate neurotransmitter production, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and tyramine. The neurotransmitter production in the intestine and delivery to the brain may play a central role in brain neurodevelopment [42]. Meanwhile, the hypothalamicÔøΩCpituitaryÔøΩCadrenal (HPA) axis form the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the brain [43]. Together, the neuroendocrine system can maintain the integrity of the immune system, IEB, and BBB. More importantly, through these ways, gut microbiota can regulate neurological outcomes and maintain the behavior and development of neural and immune systems [44,45].\nGF animals are microbial-deficient animals, in a sterile environment. These animals offer unique opportunities to explore how the gut microbiota participate in AD pathogenesis. The GF mice showed deficits in the nonspatial task (object recognition test) and reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus [46]. On the other hand, the GF mice exhibited innate immune response impairment, manifested as microglial immaturity. Whereas the GF amyloid precursor protein (APP)/PS1 mice showed a reduction in AÔøΩÔøΩ pathology, the cerebral AÔøΩÔøΩ were rescued by fecal microbiota transplantation from conventionally raised APP/PS1 control mice [26]. Fujii et al. demonstrated that mice transplanted with gut microbiota from a patient with AD exhibited behavior and cognition dysfunction [47].\nTo identify specific microbiota shifts, several studies have performed 16S rRNA sequencing in APP/PS1 transgenic mice and AD patients (Table 1). Those results highlight the significant effect of Bacteroides fragilis in cognitive impairment and brain amyloidosis [48,49,50]. From the data, we inferred that gut microbiota may participate in AD pathogenesis.\n",

Persistent neuroinflammatory and astrocytes activation contributes to the blood®Cbrain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, and thus, to neuronal death and cognitive impairment. Whereas huge efforts have been made towards the development of new drugs targeting inflammation and immune regulation [9,10,11], the options for clinical treatment remain limited [12]. Nevertheless, this reasoning led to the development of the amyloid hypothesis and subsequent pharmacology development, which also faced tremendous challenges. Therefore, the need for the development of new therapeutics against AD remains alive.</p>
<p>In the last decade, the human microbiome project has expanded our understanding of the human microbiome and disease development [13,14,15,16,17]. The intestinal microorganisms encode 4 °¡ 106 genes, which is about 150°¡ higher than humans [13,15], which ultimately contributes to the sophisticated microbial diversity. A plethora of evidence has suggested that dysbiosis of gut microbiota in human beings is closely associated with many illnesses, especially metabolic-related diseases [18,19,20] (insulin resistance Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and liver diseases), cardiovascular diseases [21], or malnutrition [22].</p>
<p>A growing number of studies have demonstrated variations in the composition of gut microbiota, which contribute to the alteration in brain function and behavior, a phenomenon referred to as the microbiota-gut-brain axis [23,24,25].</p>
<p>Studies based on germ-free (GF) animals [26], antibiotics [27], probiotics [28], or fecal microbiota transplantation [29] support the pivotal role of gut microbiota in modulating cognition, behavior, and central nervous system (CNS) physiology. Whereas there is evidence that gut microbiota affects brain physiology and A¶¬ accumulation and even AD, its regulatory role in AD still remains elusive. A newly developed drug, GV-971, has been shown to work by regulating gut microbiota dysbiosis, which elucidated a novel way in the development of new anti-AD drugs [30].</p>
<p>In this review, we summarize the gut microbiota alteration in crosstalk between the gut and the brain, mediated by the microbiota-gut-brain axis in AD pathogenesis. We highlight the significance of gut microbiota in maintaining host metabolic and immune homeostasis, as well as a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases and AD. Furthermore, we discuss recent research on AD therapy advances, especially in remodeling the gut microbiota. We highlight the potential drug candidate targeting the microbiota-gut-brain axis that may define the discovery of novel therapeutic agents.</p>

<p>Gut microbiota is a symbiotic system having bacteria, viruses, and fungi in the human gut, which affect human digestion, intestinal biosynthesis, metabolism, and inflammation [31,32]. There are up to 1,000 microbial species that are composed of 90% Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and 10% Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. Like in the legume-rhizobia symbiotic relationship, gut microbiota and the human body is unique ecosystem and is an outcome of biological evolution. Recently, a cohort study of around 2,100 gut microbiota metagenomes uncovered over 22.3 million nonredundant prokaryotic genes, with half of the genes being unique in a single person [33]. Collectively, the gut microbiota is a highly active, extremely dynamic, and vast heterogenetic ecosystem, which is defined by the host°Øs age, disease status, diet, environment, and ethnicity [34].</p>
<p>The gut microbiota ecosystem is beneficial to human health in several ways:</p>
<p>(1) Biosynthesis of metabolic co-factors, polysaccharides, and fatty acids to supplement host nutrition [35,36];
(2) Metabolism of products such as cleavage of dietary fiber into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which can modulate intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) permeability, maintain homeostasis of the host immune system and glucose homeostasis [37,38]; On the other hand, microbiota and its metabolism can drive immune functions, which is characterized by cytokine signal release, and consequently, alter the activation status and physiology of neurons and glial cells [39].
(3) Provision of protection against pathogens, as well as maintenance of the homeostasis of the microbiota composition [40,41]. On the contrary, when the IEB is dysfunctional, the secretory neurotoxins or metabolites of enterotoxigenic strains can leak through the barrier causing substantial inflammatory pathology or metabolic diseases.
(4) The neuroendocrine system regulated by microbiota can modulate neurotransmitter production, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and tyramine. The neurotransmitter production in the intestine and delivery to the brain may play a central role in brain neurodevelopment [42]. Meanwhile, the hypothalamic®Cpituitary®Cadrenal (HPA) axis form the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the brain [43]. Together, the neuroendocrine system can maintain the integrity of the immune system, IEB, and BBB.
More importantly, through these ways, gut microbiota can regulate neurological outcomes and maintain the behavior and development of neural and immune systems [44,45].</p>
<p>GF animals are microbial-deficient animals, in a sterile environment. These animals offer unique opportunities to explore how the gut microbiota participate in AD pathogenesis. The GF mice showed deficits in the nonspatial task (object recognition test) and reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus [46]. On the other hand, the GF mice exhibited innate immune response impairment, manifested as microglial immaturity. Whereas the GF amyloid precursor protein (APP)/PS1 mice showed a reduction in A¶¬ pathology, the cerebral A¶¬ were rescued by fecal microbiota transplantation from conventionally raised APP/PS1 control mice [26]. Fujii et al. demonstrated that mice transplanted with gut microbiota from a patient with AD exhibited behavior and cognition dysfunction [47].</p>
<p>To identify specific microbiota shifts, several studies have performed 16S rRNA sequencing in APP/PS1 transgenic mice and AD patients (Table 1). Those results highlight the significant effect of Bacteroides fragilis in cognitive impairment and brain amyloidosis [48,49,50]. From the data, we inferred that gut microbiota may participate in AD pathogenesis.</p>
