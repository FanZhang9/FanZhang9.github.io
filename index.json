Gut microbiota can interact with the central nervous system (CNS) through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The interaction is mediated by microbial secretions, metabolic interventions, and neural stimulation. Here, we review and summarize the regulatory pathways (immune, neural, neuroendocrine, or metabolic systems) in the microbiota-gut-brain axis in AD pathogenesis. Besides, we highlight the significant roles of the intestinal epithelial barrier and blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the microbiota-gut-brain axis. During the progression of AD, there is a gradual shift in the gut microbiota and host co-metabolic relationship, leading to gut dysbiosis, and the imbalance of microbial secretions and metabolites, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These products may affect the CNS metabolic state and immune balance through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Further, we summarize the potential microbiota-gut-brain axis-targeted therapy including carbohydrates, probiotics, dietary measures, and propose new strategies toward the development of anti-AD drugs. Taken together, the data in this review suggest that remodeling the gut microbiota may present a tractable strategy in the management and development of new therapeutics against AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.\nKeywords: AlzheimerÔøΩÔøΩs disease; Bacteroides; bloodÔøΩCbrain barrier; enteric nervous system; gut microbiota; lipopolysaccharides; microbial amyloid; microbiota-gut-brain axis; oligosaccharides; short-chain fatty acids.\n? 2021 Si-Ran Zhong et al., published by De Gruyter.\nConflict of interest statement Conflict of interest: The authors state no conflict of interest.\nFigures **\nFigure 1\n**\nThe microbiota-gut-brain axis regulatory pathwaysÔøΩÔøΩ\n**\nFigure 1\n**\nThe microbiota-gut-brain axis regulatory pathways involved in AD pathology.

An outline illustrating several important regulatory pathways between gut microbiota and the brain, including immune pathway, neural pathway, neuroendocrine pathway, biosynthesis or metabolism pathway, and their interaction relationship (Table 2). Microbial secretory products, such as LPS, play a key role in immune activation in the gut, periphery, and brain, which contribute to neuroinflammation. Neurotransmitters and neuroactive metabolites secreted by microbiota can interact with host neurotransmitter signaling and synthesis. Neural pathways including ENS and vagus nerve play a vital role in regulating gut physiologic and brain cognition behavior. Some microbial metabolites, such as SCFAs, have an important neuroprotective effect against neuroinflammation in the brain, and regulatory effects in modulating host metabolism and immunity. IEB and BBB functionality also play a significant role in host homeostasis.

It is well established that stable gut microbiota is the foundation for normal gut physiology and participate in heath signaling along the microbiota-gut-brain axis (right-hand side of this figure). The intestinal dysbiosis cascade and inappropriate microbiota-gut-brain axis signaling (right-hand side of this figure), just like the amyloid cascade hypothesis, oxidative stress, and genetic factors, have increasingly become a major research interest in AD pathogenesis. Meanwhile, the intestinal dysbiosis cascade may be a tractable target for AD drug development.\nSee this image and copyright information in PMC\n","permalink":"https://fanzhang9.github.io/post/my-paper/","summary":"Review\nFunctional roles of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease: Implications of gut microbiota-targeted therapy Si-Ran Zhong?et al.

Therefore, exploring promising targets to enhance synaptic plasticity in neurodegenerative disorders is crucial. It has been demonstrated that methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) plays a vital role in neuronal development and MeCP2 malfunction causes various neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the role of MeCP2 in neurodegenerative diseases has been less reported. In the study, we found that MeCP2 expression in the hippocampus was reduced in the hippocampus of senescence-accelerated mice P8 (SAMP8) mice. Overexpression of hippocampal MeCP2 could elevate synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in SAMP8 mice, while knockdown of MeCP2 impaired synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in senescence accelerated-resistant 1 (SAMR1) mice. MeCP2-mediated regulation of synaptic plasticity may be associated with CREB1 pathway. These results suggest that MeCP2 plays a vital role in age-related cognitive decline by regulating synaptic plasticity and indicate that MeCP2 may be promising targets for the treatment of age-related cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases.\nKeywords: MeCP2; neurodegenerative disease; synaptic plasticity.\n? 2021 The Authors.
